# DSS-Extensions: KLUSolveX

This is a fork of **KLUSolve** used by DSS C-API. See the original at [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/p/klusolve/code/HEAD/tree/). As explicit in `LICENSE`, this work uses the same license, LGPL 2.1 or later.

Changes include:
- Uses a CMake building script.
- Uses either system SuiteSparse libraries (when compatible) or downloads upstream SuiteSparse source-code. The SuiteSparse source code is not included in the KLUSolveX repository anymore.
- Adds a dependency on [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/), dropping the customized CZSparse.
- Introduces some dense matrix functions (e.g. `mvmult`) to be used in the [DSS C-API](https://github.com/dss-extensions/dss_capi/), an alternative [OpenDSS](sf.net/p/electricdss) library, for better performance.
- Introduces reuse of the symbolic and numeric factorization steps from KLU when the sparse matrix is unchanged.
- Changes calling convention to CDECL on Windows -- so far this is the only change that breaks compatibility with KLUSolve. 

For binary distributions, basic descriptions of the dependencies and licensing information is reproduced below. When building from source, be sure to check the licenses of the components.

**Currently tested with Eigen 3.3.7 and SuiteSparse 5.6.0.**

[Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) is Free Software. Starting from the 3.1.1 version, it is licensed under the MPL2, which is a simple weak copyleft license. Common questions about the MPL2 are answered in the official [MPL2 FAQ](http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/FAQ.html).

Note that currently, a few features rely on third-party code licensed under the LGPL: SimplicialCholesky, AMD ordering, and constrained_cg. Such features can be explicitly disabled by compiling with the EIGEN_MPL2_ONLY preprocessor symbol defined. Furthermore, Eigen provides interface classes for various third-party libraries (usually recognizable by the <Eigen/*Support> header name). Of course you have to mind the license of the so-included library when using them.

Virtually any software may use Eigen. For example, closed-source software may use Eigen without having to disclose its own source code. Many proprietary and closed-source software projects are using Eigen right now, as well as many BSD-licensed projects.

**COLAMD, Copyright 1998-2016, Timothy A. Davis.  http://www.suitesparse.com**


The COLAMD column approximate minimum degree ordering algorithm computes
a permutation vector P such that the LU factorization of A (:,P)
tends to be sparser than that of A.  The Cholesky factorization of
(A (:,P))'*(A (:,P)) will also tend to be sparser than that of A'*A.
SYMAMD is a symmetric minimum degree ordering method based on COLAMD,
available as a MATLAB-callable function.  It constructs a matrix M such
that M'*M has the same pattern as A, and then uses COLAMD to compute a column
ordering of M.  Colamd and symamd tend to be faster and generate better
orderings than their MATLAB counterparts, colmmd and symmmd.

BTF is a software package for permuting a matrix into block upper triangular
form.  It includes a maximum transversal algorithm, which finds a permutation
of a square or rectangular matrix so that it has a zero-free diagonal (if one
exists); otherwise, it finds a maximal matching which maximizes the number of
nonzeros on the diagonal.  The package also includes a method for finding the
strongly connected components of a graph.  These two methods together give the
permutation to block upper triangular form.
